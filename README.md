Sprint 3 Problematic Features: 
 - Thurs, 5/2: Still working with LM on the Search Furniture Function. Hopefully it will be merged today or tomorrow before submission. 
 - Fri, 5/3, 2:30pm  I haven't heard from LM so I am fixing some of the items needing addressed in Search Furniture so that I can review all code and submit. LK
 - Search Furniture: You can select more than one item (ID, category and style) to do the search. You then have to click the button for the results.
 - Return Transaction: The Remove button does not work properly.
